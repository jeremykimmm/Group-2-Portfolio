    <p>Verse 1</p>
    <p>Her skin glowed green and blue<br>
    The starry sky dimmed by fiery hues<br>
    My white dress blew in midnight's view<br>
    Of the world reborn, begun anew<br>
    Two thousand years and twenty more<br>
    And she looked beautiful as ever before<br>
    As she pushed me down into the warm<br>
    Water deep below, my clothes were torn</p>
    
    <p>Chorus</p>
    <p>Lilith, you siren<br>
    How could you do this to me?<br>
    Lilith, I'm dyin'<br>
    Why won't you set me free?</p>
    
    <p>Post-Chorus 1</p>
    <p>I tried to scream, but lilies clouded my mind<br>
    The petals softly floating into my eyes<br>
    I felt your fingers slowly crawl up my spine<br>
    We didn't have to sink for you to be mine</p>
    
    <p>Verse 2</p>
    <p>Her eyes were red as dawn<br>
    As she held me down under the pond<br>
    Fireworks filled the sky beyond<br>
    I heard the cheers from above the lawn<br>
    Cold hands brushed through my thighs<br>
    You were evil, everyone had realized<br>
    Thought I was different, thought I'd save your soul<br>
    Guess you can't save what isn't half of a whole</p>
    
    <p>Chorus</p>
    <p>Lilith, you siren<br>
    How could you do this to me?<br>
    Lilith, I'm dyin'<br>
    Why won't you set me free?</p>
  
    <p>Post-Chorus 2</p>
    <p>I tried to scream, but lilies clouded my mind<br>
    The petals softly floating into my eyes<br>
    I felt your hands as they wrapped around my neck<br>
    When did our love become this shallow shipwreck?</p>
    
    <p>Bridge</p>
    <p>Two thousand years and twenty more<br>
    And I thought I was weaker than I had ever been before<br>
    But the moonlight's rays hit the water below<br>
    And it was now or never to swim to the Garden, and, oh<br>
    Did she push and pull, tryin' to get me to drown?<br>
    But the lilies in my mind began to run around<br>
    As I gripped and dragged myself along the dirt<br>
    I turned back to face the girl I loved for all of my hurt<br>
    Said, “My dear, this is it, I have got to go”<br>
    And she faded in the deep and murky water below</p>
    
    <p>Chorus</p>
    <p>Lilith, you siren<br>
    How could you do this to me?<br>
    Lilith, I'm cryin'<br>
    My pain will stay with me<br>
    Lilith, you siren (I tried to scream, but lilies clouded my mind)<br>
    You were so cruel and so mean (The petals softly floating into my eyes)<br>
    Lilith, I'm tryin' (I felt your hands as they wrapped around my neck)<br>
    To love life now that I'm free (We didn't have to sink for you to be mine)</p>

  <p><strong>Verse 1</strong><br>
  Maybe<br>
  If that attitude took a backseat, Miss Know-It-All<br>
  You'd find a man (Find a man)<br>
  You got no chill, you can't (Ain't got no chill)<br>
  Damn, baby, and maybe<br>
  If I stopped blaming the world for my faults<br>
  I could evolve<br>
  Maybe the pressure just made me too soft</p>

  <p><strong>Pre-Chorus</strong><br>
  'Cause all I seem to do is get in my way<br>
  Then blame you, it's just a cycle, rinse, recycle<br>
  You're so sick, I'm so sick of me too</p>

  <p><strong>Chorus</strong><br>
  Call me Miss Crybaby<br>
  Call me Miss Crybaby<br>
  It's not my fault (It's not my fault)<br>
  If it's Murphy's law (If it's Murphy's law)<br>
  What can go wrong will go wrong<br>
  Telling you, crybaby<br>
  Call me a crybaby<br>
  It's not my fault (It's not my fault)<br>
  It's Murphy's law (It's Murphy's law)<br>
  What can go wrong will go wrong</p>

  <p><strong>Post-Chorus</strong><br>
  Don't I know<br>
  Don't I know<br>
  Damn it, don't I know<br>
  Oh, you know it</p>

  <p><strong>Verse 2</strong><br>
  And maybe (Maybe)<br>
  You should really stop smokin' them Backwoods so you can age backwards, please, girl<br>
  Baby, it's your world, oh<br>
  Maybe (Maybe)<br>
  You should stop focusing all of that negative blocking the positive<br>
  Trying to find, you're my blindspot, it's fine niggas<br>
  Ruin me every single time</p>

  <p><strong>Pre-Chorus</strong><br>
  'Cause all I seem to do is get in my way<br>

  You so sick, I'm so sick of me too</p>
