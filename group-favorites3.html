<p>I kissed the scars on her skin<br>
    I still think you're beautiful<br>
    And I don't ever wanna lose my best friend.<br>
    I screamed out, "God, you vulture (you vulture),<br>
    Bring her back or take me with her."</p>
    
    <p>Tear it down, break the barricade<br>
    I want to see what sound it makes<br>
    I hate this flavor with a passion and I fucking hate the aftertaste</p>
    
    <p>How does it feel? (How does it feel?)<br>
    How does it feel? Well it feels like I'm on fire!<br>
    Wake up, I know you can hear me.</p>
    
    <p>Make me a promise here tonight, love like a tidal wave<br>
    Dreamless in early graves, I never want it to be this way<br>
    The chemicals will bring you home again<br>
    This is it, when it's done, we can say that,<br>
    When it's sudden death we fight back<br>
    (Oh, yeah)</p>
    
    <p>Pretend like I don't entice you<br>
    I've seen you circling the sky above my head<br>
    You traitor</p>
    
    <p>I will never be taken for granted again<br>
    Keep digging holes in the desert<br>
    Say a prayer for you</p>
    
    <p>I know that you're in pain<br>
    But if we die at the same time does it still scare you?</p>
    
    <p>Make me a promise here tonight. Let's go!<br>
    Dreamless in early graves, I never want it to be this way<br>
    The chemicals will bring you home again<br>
    This is it, when it's done, we can say that,<br>
    Oh my God we're not gonna make it</p>
    
    <p>We will bring the tidal wave<br>
    We will bring the tidal wave<br>
    We will bring the tidal wave<br>
    We will bring the tidal wave!</p>
    
    <p>We will bring the tidal wave<br>
    We will bring the tidal wave<br>
    We will bring the tidal wave<br>
    And nothing will remain</p>
    
    <p>She's mine<br>
    You stay away from her<br>
    It's not her time.<br>
    'Cause, baby, I'm the one<br>
    Who haunts her dreams at night,<br>
    Until she's satisfied.</p>
    
    <p>Make me a promise here tonight, love like a tidal wave<br>
    Dreamless in early graves, I never want it to be this way<br>
    The chemicals will bring you home again<br>
    This is it, when it's done, we can say that,<br>
    When it's sudden death we fight back!</p>

<p>Baby, pour over<br>
    Tell me, are we concrete?<br>
    What would you do without my perfect company to your undressed spine?<br>
    And I can hear you drag behind my car by your broken legs<br>
    Swallowing stitches in her sleep<br>
    As she stole my only view, may I never blink</p>
    
    <p>While you stood over the pavement<br>
    I was biting the curb<br>
    Sick entertainment<br>
    But I'll bet it feels good coming down<br>
    Can't bear to wash out the wasted time<br>
    Between your lips and mine</p>
    
    <p>Zero friends<br>
    Followed your voices into a sea of crosses<br>
    She blends in with the foxes gold and feels like home<br>
    Under the surface, my love<br>
    But beware, beware, beware</p>
    
    <p>And take it slow tonight<br>
    We're on the other side of the road<br>
    I think we're bleeding out</p>
    
    <p>While you stood over the pavement<br>
    I was biting the curb<br>
    Sick entertainment<br>
    But I'll bet it feels good coming down<br>
    Can't bear to wash out the wasted time<br>
    Between our lips</p>
    
    <p>So c'mon and swing it back and forth just like<br>
    My heart is on a pendulum tonight<br>
    If your lungs are mine I only wanna watch your clouds linger in the darkness</p>
    
    <p>Oh, can't you feel it?<br>
    You're feeding on my restless soul<br>
    Oh, can't you see that<br>
    It's never enough, it's never enough<br>
    Oh, can't you feel it?<br>
    You feed on my restless soul<br>
    Oh, can you see that<br>
    It's never enough, it's never enough</p>
    
    <p>Today I saw the whole world<br>
    And I think heaven has a plot to take my life<br>
    Listen, I'm the one who made you<br>
    I'll be the one who brings you down<br>
    But this will be the last time</p>
    
    <p>Bite on the curb<br>
    Oh, sick entertainment<br>
    I'll bet it feels good when you're coming down<br>
    Can't bear to wash out the wasted time<br>
    Between our lips</p>
    
    <p>So c'mon and swing it back and forth just like<br>
